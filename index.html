        <h2>The Angelus</h2>
            <p>
              <ul>
                  <li>The Angel of the Lord declared to Mary: And she conceived of the Holy Spirit. <b>   HailMary...</b> </li>
                  <li>Behold the handmaid of the Lord: Be it done unto me according to Thy word. <b>    HailMary...</b></li>
                  <li>And the Word was made Flesh: And dwelt among us. <b>   HailMary...</b> </li>
                  <li>Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God, that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.<b>  HailMary...</b> </li>
                  <li><i>Let us pray:</i>Pour forth, we beseech Thee, O Lord, Thy grace into our hearts; that we, to whom the incarnation of Christ,
                      Thy Son, was made known by the message of an angel, may by His Passion and Cross be brought to the glory of His Resurrection,
                      through the same Christ Our Lord.Amen.</li>
              </ul>
           </p>
        <h2>The Apostles Creed</h2>
            <p>
              I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord,
              Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.
              He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead;
              He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.
              I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.Amen
            </p>
